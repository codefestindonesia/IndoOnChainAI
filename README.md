IndoOnChainAI Project
Welcome to the IndoOnChainAI project! This project is an application that integrates AI models to provide relevant responses based on user input. Below is the guide to get started and information on how to access the backend.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have installed Node.js and DFX.

Installation
Create an API key in Gemini AI: Visit Gemini AI to create the API key required to access the model.

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/codefestindonesia/IndoOnChainAI
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Running the Application
Start DFX:

bash
Copy
dfx start --clean
Deploy the application:

bash
Copy
dfx deploy
Run the frontend live:

bash
Copy
npm start
Accessing the Backend via Candid
Once the backend is running, you can access it through Candid. Below is an explanation of the output generated:

1. Candidates
This section contains the list of response candidates generated by the model. In this case, there is only one candidate.

2. Content
This section contains the content of the response generated by the model.

Parts
This is an array containing parts of the response. In this case, there is only one part.
Text
This is the text generated by the model. Example: "Yes, I can speak Indonesian."
3. Role
Indicates the role of the model in this context. In this case, the role is "model," meaning the response is generated by the AI model.

4. Finish Reason
Indicates the reason why the model stopped generating a response. In this case, "STOP" indicates that the model has finished its response normally.

5. Index
Indicates the index of the candidate in the list of candidates. In this case, the index is 0, meaning this is the first (and only) candidate in the list.

6. Safety Ratings
This section provides information about the safety ratings of the generated response. It includes several categories:

HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT

Indicates the likelihood that the response contains sexually explicit content. The probability is "NEGLIGIBLE" (not significant).
HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH

Indicates the likelihood that the response contains hate speech. The probability is also "NEGLIGIBLE."
HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT

Indicates the likelihood that the response contains harassment. The probability is "NEGLIGIBLE."
HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT

Indicates the likelihood that the response contains dangerous content. The probability is also "NEGLIGIBLE."
7. Usage Metadata
This section provides information about token usage in the request and response:

Prompt Token Count

The number of tokens used in the prompt (the question you sent). In this case, there are 8 tokens.
Candidates Token Count

The number of tokens used in the candidate response. In this case, there are 8 tokens.
Total Token Count

The total number of tokens used in the request and response. In this case, the total is 16 tokens.
8. Model Version
Indicates the version of the model used to generate the response. In this case, the model version is "gemini-pro."
